# SFTC Docker

# Learning the Basics of Docker
---

## Introduction to Docker
- `Images` are the templates to build containers on.
    - Or one could base a custom image off a base image.
- `Containers` are running instances of images.

## Containers vs VirtualMachines

## Docker Architecture

## Docker Installation
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker docker.io docker-engine
```

## Creating our First Image

First to see our images and check our docker version:
```
docker images
docker version
```

Let's us know API version and google-go version for Docker Daemon.
```
docker info
```

- Locations
    - **Where Container Details are Located**
        - `var/lib/docker` is where all `images/containers` are stored
        - cd `var/lib/docker/containers/<hex>`
    - **Where Images are Located**
        - ls `/var/lib/docker/image/aufs/imagedb/content/sha256`

Whats Running
```
docker ps
```

What has run (With no name passed, it makes up a name)
```
docker ps -a
```

We can refer to a Container or Image by `IMAGE ID`, `CONTAINER_ID` or either ones `NAME`

#### Pull an image
```
docker pull ubuntu (would be latest)
docker pull ubuntu:trusty (Or any tag listed in dockerhub)
```

"Container Layers build the docker image"

#### Launch container
(i = interactive, -t = attach to terminal)
This will launch the container, but not keep it running once we exit

```
docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
```

```
docker ps -a
```

Grab name name of what we ran, eg 'adoring_einstein'

```
docker restart adoring_einstein
docker ps
docker attach adoring_einstein  (Logs us in)
```

#### Keep the container running in Background
(disconnected/daemonized)

```
docker run -itd ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
```

#### Run another Instance

```
docker run -itd ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
```

#### Info about the Base image
```
docker inspect ubuntu:xenial
docker ps  (See the different names)
```

#### Info about Container
```
docker ps -a
docker inspect compassionate_bhaskara
docker inspect compassionate_bhaskara | grep IP
```

#### Going into container

```
docker attach compassionate_bhaskara
<Enter>
```

#### Stopping Containers
```
docker stop <name>
docker ps -a
```

#### Searching for containers
```
docker search ruby
docker search training/sinatra
```

#### Instance Examples
```
docker pull training/sinatra
docker run -it training/sinatra /bin/bash
gem
gem list --local
```

#### Create a file in this instance
```
cd /root
echo "Testing" > test.txt
exit
```

#### Notice new instances don't have our old items
```
docker run -it training/sinatra /bin/bash
ls /root
```

#### We can reboot our old instance
```
docker ps -a
docker restart sad_bohr
docker attach sad_bohr
ls /root         ;(Our test.txt remains)
```

## Packaging a custom container

Instantiate a Container and update some items
```
docker ps -a
docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
cd /root
echo "This is version 1 of our custom image" > image_version.txt
apt-get update
apt-get install telnet openssh-server

adduser test

which sshd
which telnet

cat /etc/group | grep test

docker ps -a

docker restart compassionate_cori
docker attach compassionate_cori

docker commit -m "Already installed SSH and created test user" -a "imboyus" compassionate_cori imboyus/ubuntusshd:v1

docker images

docker run -it imboyus/ubuntusshd:v1 /bin/bash
```

#### Build a Dockerfile from box

```
vim Dockerfile
```

**Dockerfile**
```
# This is a ubuntu image with SSH already installed
FROM ubuntu:xenial
MAINTAINER imboyus <imboyus@gmail.com>
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y telnet openssh-server
```

```
docker build -t="imboyus/ubuntusshdonly:v2" .
docker images
docker run -t imboyus/ubuntusshdonly:v2 /bin/bash
```

## Running Container Commands with Docker

```
docker images
docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
```

```
ps
```

- Processes (`ps`) are contained within the docker container,
- Yet, the perfomance (`top`) shows the host system performance.

#### See the logs from a container (Running or not running)
```
docker ps -a
docker restart cocky_archimedes
docker ps
docker logs cocky_archimedes
```

#### Run commands on a running container
Exec only works on running containers nor will it auto-start it.
```
docker exec cocky_archimedes /bin/cat /etc/profile

How to know for sure:
---------------------
docker attach cocky_archimedes
vi /etc/profile     (edit something)

docker restart cocky_archimedes
docker exec cocky_archimedes /bin/cat /etc/profile
```

```
docker run ubuntu:xenial /bin/echo "Hello from this Container"
ps -a  (Notice this creates an instance, though not running)

; the name, eg: admiring_meitner

docker logs admiring_meitner
```

#### Containerize

```
docker run -d ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash -c "while true; do echo  HELLO; sleep 1; done"
docker ps
docker logs lonely_bose
docker logs lonely_bose | wc -l
docker stop lonely_bose
```

##Exposing Container with Port Redirects

A port must be exposed to the underlying Host.

```
; We know this uses port 80

docker pull nginx:latest
```

```
docker run -d nginx:latest
docker ps
docker inspect zen_goldberg

Look at the IP Address, eg: 172.17.0.2
```

Install Text Web browser
```
apt-get install elinks
```

See it running
```
elinks http://172.17.0.2
elinks http://localhost (does not find it on underlying host)
```

Run in Daemon mode redirect my local port order to the remote port
```
docker ps
docker stop zen_goldberg

eg: docker run -d -p <local>:<container/remote> nginx:latest

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
docker ps

elinks http://172.17.0.2  (Works)
elinks http://localhost:8080  (Its redirecting traffic from docker daemon)
```

# The Dockerfile, Builds and Network Configuration
---

##Dockerfile Directives: USER and RUN
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

`Folder: buids/01_RunAsUser`
```
docker pull centos:latest
```

*Dockerfile*

FROM must be the first directive

```
# Dockerfile based on the latest CentOS 7 image - non-privileged user entry
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER imboyus@gmail.com

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user
USER user
```

docker build -t centos7/nonroot:v1 .
docker run -it centos centos7/nonroot:v1 /bin/bash

_note: When rebuilding an image, it only changes additions and keeps the cache from already existing command builds_

Since a user can't login, we login as user:
```
docker ps -a
docker start cocky_boyd
docker exec -u 0 -it cocky_boyd /bin/bash
```

## Dockerfile Directives: RUN Order of Execution

`Folder: buids/02_CustomMessage`

- **Order of Execution**
    - `FROM`
    - `MAINTAINER`
    - `RUN`
        - * _If you make a `USER` AFTER this, everything will run as THAT user_

- **Important**
    - `RUN`: execute at build time, becomes part of the base image.
    - `CMD`: Runs when a container is instantiated, eg: Run an application.

```
docker build -t centos7/config:v1 .
docker run -it centos7/config:v1 /bin/bash
cat /etc/exports.list
```

## Dockerfile Directives: ENV
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

`Folder: buids/03_JavaInstall`

**When doing updates or installs always do `apt-get update -y` or `yum update -y`**

```
Docker build -t centos7/java8:v1 .      (You'll see red, that's ok)
```

Check the `ENV` is set for Java, though limited to one user
```
docker images
docker run -it centos7/java8:v1 /bin/bash
env
```

Control System-wide variables
```
Dockerfile:
ENV JAVA_BIN /usr/java/jdk1.8.0/jre
```

```
docker run -it centos7/java8:v2 /bin/bash
env     (Now we see JAVA_HOME global)
```

##Dockerfile Directives: CMD vs RUN

`Folder: buids/04_EchoServer`

- Differences
    - `RUN`: execute at build time, becomes part of the **base image**.
    - `CMD`: Runs when a container is instantiated, or container starts. eg: Run an application. **not part of the build process**

```
docker build -t centos7/echo:v1 .
docker images
docker run centos7/echo:v1  ; Should see an echo from the CMD
```

## Dockerfile Directives: ENTRYPOINT

`Folder: buids/05_Entry`

Sets default application used everytime a container is created even if you ask it to do something else.

```
docker build -t centos7/entry:v1 .
docker images

; Test these
docker run centos7/entry:v1
docker run centos7/echo:v1  /bin/bash echo "See me?"      ; Yes (Notice this is /echo)
docker run centos7/entry:v1  /bin/bash echo "See me?"     ; No
docker run centos7/entry:v1                               ; Outputs default CMD
```

- Difference between `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`
    - `ENTRYPOINT` - Runs no matter what
    - `CMD` - CAN be overwritten for a command, eg: in an echo example above

## Dockerfile Directives: EXPOSE

`Folder: buids/06_ApacheInstallation`

- **Commands**
    - `-P` is to run/remap any ports in the container

```
docker build -t centos7/apache:v1 .
docker images

; Run container as daemon so it doesn't exit and think it's done

docker run -d --name apacheweb1 centos7/apache:v1
docker ps
docker inspect apacheweb1 | grep IPAdd
```
__Dont worry about the red GPG keys__

See it all works
```
elinks http://172.17.0.3
docker exec apacheweb1 /bin/cat /var/www/html/index.html
docker ps    (Container still running)
```

No Ports Exposed, so:
```
docker stop apacheweb1

docker run -d --name apacheweb2 -P centos7/apache:v1
docker ps    (no ports exposed still)
docker stop apacheweb2
```

Manually Remap ports **outside** of `Dockerfile`
````
docker run -d --name apacheweb3 -p 8080:80 centos7/apache:v1
docker ps    (ports are exposed)
elinks http://localhost:8080
```

In `Dockerfile`, add:
```
EXPOSE 80
```

Rebuild and check!
```
docker build -t centos7/apache:v1 .
docker run -d --name apacheweb4 -P centos7/apache:v1
docker ps
```

##Container Volume Management
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

`Folder: buids/07_MyHostDir`

- Volumes:
    - Mounts
    - File Systems (`FS`)
    - `-v` Flag
        - 1: Create a mount outside containers `FS`, Exposes whatever we put in there to underlying host,
        - 2: Gives ability to provide direct access from host mount to container (eg vagrant, no NFS needed)

```
docker run -it --name voltest1 -v /mydata centos:latest /bin/bash
df -h  (See a /mydata folder which is outside the normal container)

echo "this is a test container file" > /mydata/mytext.txt
exit
```

Where is `/mydata/mytext.txt?
```
docker inspect voltest1 | grep Source
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/<hash-code-here>/_data
cat mytext.txt

# This will be in the mount on a base image:
echo "this is from me 2" > host.txt
```

Sync <local-path>:<container-path>
```
docker run -it --name voltest2 -v ~/docker-course/builds/07_MyHostDir:/mydata centos:latest /bin/bash
```

You can use the `VOLUMES` directive in `Dockerfile`, but local files may not be available
for containers, so it may not always be the best for mass distribution.


##Docker Network: List and Inspect
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

You can see `docker0` which is a bridge default on `172.17.0.1` below, and it will grab an available IP from docker0:

```
ifconfig    ( look at docker0)
```

Current networks associated with current host:
```
; These are always unique identifiers
docker network ls

; If you need to see the full hash
docker network ls --no-trunc
```

Get Details about a network:

```
docker network inspect bridge
```

##Docker Network: Create and Remove
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

```
Right:
man docker-network-create (Use this)

Wrong:
man docker network create (Does not work)
```

Create a `network` with new subnet to use with a `bridge` for local adapters:

__Most of the time you create subnets for locally routed interal items.__
```
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 mybridge01
docker network ls

ifconfig    (br-<hash> matches the docker network ls ID)
```

Remove a network, be careful to not remove the default 3 networks. You cannot undo it,
and if you do you are better off re-installing docker completely.

```
docker network rm mybridge01
docker network ls
```

Recreate
```
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 mybridge01
docker network inspect mybridge01
docker network rm mybridge01
```

##Docker Network: Assign to Containers
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Control how IP's are assigned to our Containers.

Class B network with subnet having large range of addresses, and tell the host only to assign IP's to containers from a subset range for that network.

(About 190 IP's available)

- `--gateway` is how to route to pass the traffic from the underlying host
- `--driver`
    - `bridge` is for a simple setup
    - `overlay` is for a multi-cluster

```
ip/24 = 1-254 (Class C address, last octet)

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 --ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network bridge04

docker network ls
docker network inspect bridge04
ifconfig
```

Create a Docker Container and use Network
```
docker run -it --name nettest1 --net bridge04 centos:latest /bin/bash

yum update
yum install -y net-tools
ifconfig   (We have 10.1.4.0)
netstat -rn
ping google.com
cat /etc/resolv.conf

exit
```

Static IP's only work on user created networks.
```
docker run -it --name nettest2 --net bridge04 --ip 10.1.4.100 centos:latest /bin/bash
yum update
yum install -y net-tools
ifconfig    (Should show inet 10.1.4.100)
netstat -rn
```

In a new Terminal with the container running we can do:
```
docker inspect nettest2 | grep IPAddr
ping 10.1.4.100
```

Pre-Register DNS with Static IP's, which helps with provisioning and such by using
a static IP.


# Docker Commands and Structures
---

##Inspect Container Processes
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

A one time view of what's in top:
```
docker top compassionate_cori
```

Get in the box and rather than `attach` this will not close the system when running
```
docker exec -it compassionate_cori /bin/bash
top
```

With two terminals we can monitor in real-time:
```
docker stats compassionate_cori
```

##Previous Container Management
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

See only the ID's of containers
```
docker ps -a -q
```

See how many images there are
```
docker ps -a -q  | wc -l
```
####Remove a running container
```
docker run zen_goldberg
docker ps
; See we can interact
docker exec zen_goldberg /bin/cat /etc/profile

docker rm -f zen_goldberg
```

####Remove all containers that have run
There is no command to remove all docker containers.  Yet, we can do this:
```
docker rm `sudo docker ps -a -q`
```

####Stop Docker and Remove Container files
```
sudo systemctl stop docker
cd /var/lib/docker/containers
rm -rf <hash>
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

When the hash folder (`config`) is missing for an existing package docker won't run it.


##Controlling Port Exposure on Containers
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Run in disconnected mode
```
docker run -itd nginx:latest
docker ps  (80 and 443 are exposed, but not forwarded)

; Get the IP
docker inspect trusting_volhard | grep IP
```

Run with the ports remapped locally
```
docker run -itd -p 8080 nginx:latest
docker ps  (8080 is mapped)
elinks http://172.17.0.2

docker ps
docker stop drunk_carson
```

Expose ports nicely
```
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
elinks http://localhost:8080
elinks http://172.17.0.2
```

Expose unlimited ports with `-p`
```
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 nginx:latest
```

Expose all ports with `-P`
```
docker run -itd -P nginx:latest  (Exposes all ports)
docker inspect big_leavitt | grep IP
docker ps (See what ports were assigned)

elinks http://172.17.0.3
elinks http://localhost:32770
```

Bind only to local port (The IP from inspect wont work in this case)
```
docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80 nginx:latest
docker ps
elinks http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

Bind to UDP only option (TCP Default)
```
docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80/udp nginx:latest
```

##Naming our Containers
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Rather than let docker daemon make `container names` we can control them nicer.

- Image names are always lowercase
- Container names are generally lowercase
    - No spacing, or special characters, Allowed are dash(`-`) and underscore(`_`)

```
docker run -itd --name mycontainername ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
docker ps
```

####Rename a Previously run container
```
docker ps -a
docker rename trusting_volhard myrenamedcontainer
docker rename <hash-id> newnamehere
```

You cannot change the `container id`, nor should you want to.

####Rename running containers
```
docker ps
docker rename lonely_colden superman
docker ps
```

##Docker Events
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Have three terminals open.
```
docker run -itd --name c1 ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
docker run -itd --name c2 ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
docker run -itd --name c3 ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
```

####See Events and Listen
In another terminal run
```
docker events --since '1h'
```

In a third terminal run
```
docker events
```

Run this in the first terminal
```
docker exec -it c1 /bin/bash
```

This will show the event shutdown
```
docker attach c1
exit        (See log terminal)
```

####Filters

```
docker events -f   (shorthand)
docker events --filter=(event, container, image, label, type, volume, network, daemon)
```

```
docker events --filter event=attach
docker attach c3    (See log terminal)
```

####Multiple Filters
Note: exiting `-it` mode will cause a die event.
```
docker events --filter event=attach --filter event=die --filter event=stop

docker stop c3
```

##Managing and Removing Base Images
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

If you have a container which based upon a base image,
it will have a conflict and you should remove the container first.
```
docker images
docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash
exit

docker rmi ubuntu:xenial

Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "ubuntu:xenial" (must force) - container 7607e77c270a is using its referenced image bd3d4369aebc
```

You can force remove a container base image, and restart
the container.
```
docker rmi -f ubuntu:xenial
```

If a container has multiple references with the same Repository, you must use `-f`
```
docker rmi -f centos7/java8
```

##Saving and Loading Docker Images
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

We can tar a file and save it, and load it later without having to back it up to a repository

```
docker pull centos:latest
docker run -it centos:latest /bin/bash
exit
docker ps -a           (Find the last run container at top)
```

####Save an Image to File
```
docker commit romantic_mestorf centos:mine
docker rm romantic_mestorf
docker images

These will all do the same thing:
---------------------------------
docker save centos:latest > centos.latest.tar
docker save -o centos.latest.tar centos:latest
docker save --output centos.latest.tar centos:latest
```

####More Compression
```
tar tvf centos.latest.tar

; To save disk space:
gzip centos.latest.tar  (200mb to 70mb)
```

####Load the Saved File
Restore the image
```
docker load --input centos.latest.tar.gz
docker images
```

##Image History
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Let's us see the details of the build, only available on images and not containers.
```
docker history centos:mine
docker history --no-trunc centos:mine
docker history --quiet nginx
docker history --quiet --no-trunc nginx
```

##Taking Control of Our Tags
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Tagging an Image will share the same Image ID.
```
docker tag 4efb2fcdb1ab mine/centos:v1.0
docker tag mine/centos:v1.0 imboyus.server/centos:v1.0.1b
```

##Pushing to DockerHub
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

- Head over to [DockerHub](http://dockerhub.com)
- Has same naming conventions as Git, eg (jream/name)
- Create a Repository, make it Private
    - Public repositories don't require a login
- Everything will be empty

To get into DockerHub from terminal
```
docker login
docker logout
```

Create an image and push it
```
docker tag ubuntu:xenial jream/myubuntu
docker login
docker push jream/myubuntu
```

```
docker rmi jream/myubuntu
docker pull jream/myubuntu
```

####Shorthand Login
```
docker login -u="user" -p="12345"
docker login --user="user" --password="12345"

; Optional Server besides DockerHub
docker login --user="user" --password="12345" http://optional.server
```

# Integration and use Cases

##Building a Web Farm for Development and Testing - Prerequisites
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

- Working Locally
- Git
- Modem/Network Routing
- `ifconfig` - get the Ethernet or WAN inet addr
- Nginx Proxy Load Balancer on Multiple Nodes
- Host Multiple Domains over Multiple Ports

##Building a Web Farm for Development and Testing - Part 1
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

```
docker pull centos:centos6
docker run -it centos:centos6 /bin/bash

yum install wget
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum update

yum install which sudo httpd php openssh-server
which service   ; /sbin/service
```

Autostart applications (This is kinda odd)
```
...
...
vi ~/.bashrc

# Add services we want to start (This is wrong)
/sbin/services httpd start
/sbin/services openssh-server start
```

Copy the container ID from `root@4f832af4d240`, or whatever it is.

```
docker commit 4f832af4d240 centos6:baseweb
docker images

docker run -it centos6:baseweb /bin/bash
```

There is an error, so we are going to remove the box and rather than start from scratch use the same instance we ran, in this case `4f832af4d240`.

```
docker start 4f832af4d240
docker attach 4f832af4d240
vim ~/.bashrc

; Change to:
service httpd start
service shhd start

exit
```

Resave the image
```
docker commit 4f832af4d240 centos6:baseweb
docker run -it centos6:baseweb /bin/bash
```

##Building a Web Farm for Development and Testing - Part 2
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

- Made a `docker` folder
    - made a `dockerwww` folder
    - Copied a silly `oswd.org` template

```
docker run --name=webtest -it centos6:baseweb /bin/bash
exit
docker rm webtest
```

Try mounting
```
docker run --name=webtest -v ~/docker-course/docker/dockerwww:/var/www/html -it centos6:baseweb /bin/bash
exit
```

We could use `dockerwww` as a git repository.

```
docker start webtest
docker attach webtest
ps aux | grep httpd  ; make sure apache running
ifconfig  ; see the ip
df -h  ; see /var/www/html is there
```

##Building a Web Farm for Development and Testing - Part 3
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

Commit to create a new image to base off.
```
docker ps -a
docker commit webtest centos6:serverv1
```

Files don't mount obviously since we ran it from a command line and inherit the configuration, nor have we run from a Dockerfile.
```
docker run -it centos6:serverv1 /bin/bash
ps aux | grep httpd
df -h ;
```

Port it up
```
docker run --name=externalweb -p 8081:80  -it -v ~/docker-course/docker/dockerwww:/var/www/html centos6:serverv1 /bin/bash
```

New terminal, then web browser
```
ifconfig   ; ens33
http://192.168.88.133:8081
http://localhost:8081
```

##Building a Web Farm for Development and Testing - Part 4
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

```
docker ps -a
docker commit externalweb centos6:finalwebv1
docker images
```

Not sure the point of this
```
cp -R dockerwww dockergit
```

Run in disconnected mode
```
; if needed:
docker rm devweb1

#### Use Nginx to Proxy and Load Balance
```
apt-get install nginx
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Im installing locally, not a server, so Ill use 8888
```
upstream containerapp {
    server 192.168.88.133:8081;
    server 192.168.88.133:8082;
}

server {
    listen *:8888;

    server_name 192.168.88.133;
    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/localweb.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/localerr.log;


    location / {
        proxy_pass http://containerapp;
    }
}
```

Restart nginx
```
sudo service nginx restart
```

In Browser
```
http://localhost:8888
```

Meh..


##Integrating Custom Network in Your Docker Containers
[(Back to Top)](#table-of-contents)

**This is not good to do on a VM, Bridging problems, I would skip this**

It's import to **stop** docker daemon
```
sudo service docker stop
```

Modifying our Internal Network (10.10.100.1 Entry Point).
Below does not add it permanently, nor does it seem to work on Xenial even with sudo.
```
ip link add br10 type bridge
ip addr add 10.10.100.1/24 dev br10
ip link set br10 up
```

Rather, you can add this to `sudo vim /etc/network/interface`:
```
auto br10
iface br10 inet static
    address 10.10.100.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    bridge_ports dummy0
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0
```

```
sudo service networking restart
; We'll probably have an error but it will be up
ifconfig
```

Attach to interface bridge
```
sudo service docker start
docker.io -d -b br10 &
```

**docker.io** is called this because it int

In new terminal
```
docker run -it centos:centos6 /bin/bash
ifconfig  ; 10.10.100.2 ~ IP Range
ping 10.10.100.1  ~ See we can access the underlying network
```

Misc Options
```
# Disable
ip link set br10 down

# Remove
ip addr del 10.10.100.1/24 dev br10

# Check Route
ip route show
```

 apt-get install bridge-utils
